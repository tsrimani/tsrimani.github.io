Research experience
======
* <b>New Computing System Architectures Leveraging New Nanotechnologies</b>
  * Led development and tape-out for first Monolithic 3D (M3D) IC from foundry leveraging Carbon Nanotube FETs (CNFETs), Resistive RAM (RRAM), and silicon, targeting 5-10× EDP benefit vs. iso-design-footprint and iso-memory-capacity 2D silicon-only ICs (DATE 2023)
  * Demonstrated first iso-footprint, iso-performance CNFET-RRAM memory stack compared to Si-RRAM memory stack compared at the same technology node measured from the same wafers from the same foundry (VLSI 2023, technology focus session)
    
* <b> Emerging Nanomaterials and Nanodevices </b>
  * Led development and optimization efforts for CNFET process
    * Back-gate CNFET CMOS (TNANO, 2018, ACS Nano 2018) which enabled the first CNFET RISC-V microprocessor (Nature 2019)
    * High-volume extraction of 99.99% pure semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to meet carbon nanotube FET (CNFET) VLSI target (Advanced Electronic Materials 2022) and compatibility with silicon CMOS foundries
      
* <b>Foundry Integration </b>
  * Led transition of CNFET process from “lab” to multiple commercial “fabs”
    * First commercial CNFET process: Integration of CNFET process at Analog Devices Inc. (ADI), Wilmington, MA (Nature Electronics 2020, EE Times, MIT News, Scitech Daily, EurekAlert) for research and development of future products (incorporated within ADI’s technology roadmap)
