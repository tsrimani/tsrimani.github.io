* <b>New Computing System Architectures Leveraging New Nanotechnologies</b>
  * Led development and tape-out for first Monolithic 3D (M3D) IC from foundry leveraging Carbon Nanotube FETs (CNFETs), Resistive RAM (RRAM), and silicon, targeting 5-10× EDP benefit vs. iso-design-footprint and iso-memory-capacity 2D silicon-only ICs (DATE 2023)
  * Demonstrated first iso-footprint, iso-performance CNFET-RRAM memory stack compared to Si-RRAM memory stack compared at the same node measured from the same wafers from the same foundry (VLSI 2023, technology focus session)
    
* <b> Emerging Nanomaterials and Nanodevices </b>
  * Led development and optimization efforts for CNFET process
    * Back-gate CNFET CMOS (TNANO, 2018, ACS Nano 2018) which enabled the first CNFET RISC-V microprocessor (Nature 2019)
    * High-volume extraction of 99.99% pure semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to meet carbon nanotube FET (CNFET) VLSI target (Advanced Electronic Materials 2022) and compatibility with silicon CMOS foundries
